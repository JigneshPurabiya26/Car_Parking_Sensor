# Car_Parking_Sensor
This is a Hardware Project based on sensors for sensing the obstacles at the front and rear end of a vehicle.The basic premise of this project is that the closer a reversing car gets to an object, the greater the frequency of beeps from a buzzer. Eventually if the car gets too close to an object, the buzzer will remain on continuously.

In order to create this project we only need a handful of cheap components which are listed below:-
- Arduino UNO
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Buzzer
- Breadboard
- Connector leads
- 9v Battery 
- Battery connector

On assembling this component we need to then write a code for the machine to detect the objects, the code is to be written in the Arduino IDE and then it should be uploaded in the Arduino UNO Micro-controller.Below is the video displaying the working of the project when kept in front of an obstacle for example:- Wall.
